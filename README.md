Simple, elegant, responsive documentation. This theme is based on the [envisioned-css](https://github.com/nogginfuel/envisioned-css) repo. The theme provides styles for margin notes, side notes, figures and responsive tables. 

To get the full use of the responsive tables you must also utilize the [YellowTablesaw-StackOnly](https://github.com/nogginfuel/YellowTablesaw-StackOnly) plugin as well as the [YellowJquery](https://github.com/nogginfuel/YellowJquery) plugin to use the full power of the theme. It's recommended that you install both plugins.
